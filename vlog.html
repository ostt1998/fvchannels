          A video blog or video log, usually shortened to vlog, is a form of blog for which the
          medium is video, and is a form of web television. Vlog entries often combine embedded
          video (or a video link) with supporting text, images, and other metadata. Entries can be
          recorded in one take or cut into multiple parts.In recent years Vlogging has evolved
          into a giant community on social media where people can release any information that
          they want. Vlogs are a unique way for people to help people in so many aspects of their lives.
          Written Blogs can't provide a visual design in the ways Vlogs can deliver deeper context through imagery.

          Esther, (whose last name is not known), better known as Ter, is a Spanish
          architect and youtuber who uploads vlogs. In his channel, Ter talks about
          various themes of art and architecture. Sometimes he makes somewhat absurd
          comparisons between architectural works and musical pieces, or mixes gossip or
          frivolous themes with more intellectual things (like that time when he said that
          Le Corbusier's work was torn apart by Kim Kardashian's butt).</div>
